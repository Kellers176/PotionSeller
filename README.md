# PotionSeller
This is a Production 2 project that my team and I created in Unreal using Blueprints. Our team decided to create a platform shop-management game about potion making and alchemy. The player is a young apprentice and his teacher has accidentally turned himself into gold. As the apprentice, you must take over the shop and turn him back into his normal self. The apprentice must learn new potions while fulfilling customers orders.

To Open (Need to download Unreal Engine to use):

1- Navigate to PotionSeller/prototype2repo/Project/ then double-click to open up Prototype2.uproject

2- In Unreal Engine, open up the Maps folder under Content

3- Double-Click on Level2 (Level1 was a prototype/blockout level and was deleted so thats why it is called Level2)

4- Once in the level, press Play to start

How to play the game:
Disclaimer: Since this game was a 2-week Prototype, there are a few things missing. The main thing that is missing is the Recipe Book. However, the game is still playable as all other core features are in.

1- Once in the level, Click on the play window.

2- To talk with customers, simply walk up to them

3- Create potions by exploring the area to pick items up

4- Once you have a corresponding item to a recipe, simply drop it into the cauldron

5- When all correct items are placed, the potion will appear

6- Give the newley created potion to the customer

Controls

1- Use WASD to move around

2- Use Space Bar to jump

3- Use Left-Click to pick up objects and drop them
